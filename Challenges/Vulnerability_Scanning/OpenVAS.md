## Accessing the Web Interface

If you are using the pre-configured VM provided in the OpenVAS Skills Assessment section:

- URL: [https://<IP>:8080](https://<IP>:8080)
- **Credentials:**
  - Username: `htb-student`
  - Password: `HTB_@cademy_student!`

You can also use these credentials to SSH into the target VM and configure OpenVAS.
