# Hack The Box Sessions Log

## Description

This repository serves as a detailed log of my Hack The Box (HTB) sessions. Each session includes a breakdown of the machines or challenges I worked on, methodologies used, tools employed, and lessons learned. The goal is to track progress, document techniques, and refine my penetration testing skills.
